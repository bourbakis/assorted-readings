> Deep learning techniques are so powerful because they learn the best way to represent the problem while learning how to solve the problem.

This is called representation learning.

Representation learning is perhaps the biggest differentiation between deep learning models and classical machine learning algorithm.

It is the power of representation learning that is spurring such great creativity in the way the techniques are being used.
