You must write an interpreter for a toy imperative language named ART-C (which is shorthand for Another Rhetorical Toy-C). The interpreter must be written in Scheme and must use none of the imperative features of Scheme. A code-base is provided that you must build on. This code-base consists of several files that must be downloaded and then referenced by the file that you must create. - Google Search
