> China risks overplaying its hand if they try to force too many of the existing tariffs into phase one. President Trump and General Secretary Xi clearly want a deal, so I still think the odds are good there is a phase one deal before the end of the year, but it may not be as done a deal as many seem to think.

Johnson offers a portrait of President Xi, who has consolidated power and alliances domestically and throughout the region, and discusses the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to make its own case globally. Johnson and Morell also discuss the latest on the emerging U.S.-China trade deal, Beijing's response to the Hong Kong protests, and the attention paid overseas to the ongoing impeachment inquiry in the U.S._

> Richard is a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney and before that he was a journalist with the Financial Times. His 2010 book [The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers](https://amzn.to/2SnOXBn) is still required reading for understanding the Communist Party and his 2017 book [Asia's Reckoning: China, Japan, and the Fate of U.S. Power in the Pacific Century](https://amzn.to/2O2UI9g) is also excellent.
