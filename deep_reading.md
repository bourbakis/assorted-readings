> China risks overplaying its hand if they try to force too many of the existing tariffs into phase one. President Trump and General Secretary Xi clearly want a deal, so I still think the odds are good there is a phase one deal before the end of the year, but it may not be as done a deal as many seem to think.

We should translate our deep love the people's leader into a high degree of self-consciousness in carrying out the "two safeguards". We should stay true to our original aspiration and keep our mission in mind.

> Richard is a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney and before that he was a journalist with the Financial Times. His 2010 book [The Party: The Secret World of China's Communist Rulers](https://amzn.to/2SnOXBn) is still required reading for understanding the Communist Party and his 2017 book [Asia's Reckoning: China, Japan, and the Fate of U.S. Power in the Pacific Century](https://amzn.to/2O2UI9g) is also excellent.
