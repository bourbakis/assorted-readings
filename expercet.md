> The authors of The Economic Effects of Constitutions use econometric tools to study what they call the "missing link" between constitutional systems and economic policy; the book is an uncompromisingly empirical sequel to their previous theoretical analysis of economic policy. Taking recent theoretical work as a point of departure, they ask which theoretical findings are supported and which are contradicted by the facts. The results are based on comparisons of political institutions across countries or time, in a large sample of contemporary democracies. They find that presidential/parliamentary and majoritarian/proportional dichotomies influence several economic variables: presidential regimes induce smaller public sectors, and proportional elections lead to greater and less targeted government spending and larger budget deficits. Moreover, the details of the electoral system (such as district magnitude and ballot structure) influence corruption and structural policies toward economic growth.Persson and Tabellini's goal is to draw conclusions about the causal effects of constitutions on policy outcomes. But since constitutions are not randomly assigned to countries, how the constitutional system was selected in the first place must be taken into account. This raises challenging methodological problems, which are addressed in the book. The study is therefore important not only in its findings but also in establishing a methodology for empirical analysis in the field of comparative politics.

> The name “platform” is a descriptive one: it is the foundation on which entire ecosystems are built. The most famous example of a platform — one with which regulators are intimately familiar — is Microsoft Windows. Windows provided an operating system for personal computers, a set of APIs for developers, and a user interface for end users, to the benefit of all three groups: developers could write applications that made personal computers useful to end users, thanks to the Windows platform tying everything together.

> “Aggregator” is also descriptive: Aggregators collect a critical mass of users and leverage access to those users to extract value from suppliers. The best example of an Aggregator is Google. Google offered a genuine technological breakthrough with Google Search that made the abundance of the Internet accessible to users; as more and more users began their Internet sessions with Google, suppliers — in this case websites — competed to make their results more attractive to and better suited to Google, the better to acquire end users from Google, which made Google that much better and more attractive to end users.

In other words, the implication of Airbnb building a platform of trust is not that a homestay is now more trustworthy than a hotel; rather, it’s that the trust advantage of a hotel has been neutralized, allowing homestays to compete on new vectors, including convenience, cost, and environmental factors.

> The worldwide rise of sovereign wealth funds is emblematic of the ongoing transformation of nation-state economic prospects. _Sovereign Wealth Funds_ maps the global footprints of these financial institutions, examining their governance and investment management, and issues of domestic and international legitimacy. Through a variety of case studies--from the China Investment Corporation to the funds of several Gulf states--the authors show that the forces propelling the adoption and development of sovereign wealth funds vary by country. The authors also show that many of these investment institutions have identifiable commonalities of form and function that match the core institutions of Western financial markets.
> 
> The authors suggest that the international legitimacy of sovereign wealth funds is based on the degree to which their design and governance match Western expectations about investment management. Undercutting commonplace assumptions about the emerging world of the twenty-first century, the authors demonstrate that even small countries with large and globally oriented sovereign wealth funds are likely to play a significant role in international relations.

> This book is about the renaissance of cities in the twenty first century and their increasing role as centers of creative economic activity. It attempts to put some conceptual and descriptive order around issues of urbanization in the contemporary world, emphasizing the idea of the social economy of the metropolis, which is to say, a view of the urban organism as an intertwined system of social and economic life played out through the arena of urban space. The book opens with a review of some essentials of urban theory, the book aims to re-articulate the urban question in a way that is relevant to city life and politics in the present era. It then analyses the functional characteristics of the urban economy, with special reference to the rise of a group of core sectors such as media, fashion, music, etc., focused on cognitive and cultural forms of work. These sectors are growing with great rapidity in the world's largest cities at the present time, and they play a major role in the urban resurgence that has been occurring of late. The discussion then explores the spatial ramifications of this new economy in cities and the ways in which it appears to be ushering in major shifts in divisions of labor and urban social stratification, as marked by a growing divide between a stratum of elite workers on the one side and a low-wage proletariat on the other. Allen Scott is one of the world's foremost thinkers on the economies of modern cities, and in this book presents a concise introduction to his innovative and insightful perspective.

> '_Scott's book is a remarkable treatment of the emerging global economy, weaving together the frontiers of technology and the ways in which labor is managed and surplus created with the cities of tomorrow. His book challenges conventional notions of the 'global city' to provide a more nuanced account of the ways in which the emerging cultural-cognitive economy of the 21st century is producing urban landscapes. His conception of the city of tomorrow is informed by deep knowledge of the contemporary city around the world and provides the reader with the conceptual building blocks to re-frame how we think about urbanization now and in the future._'

> Description:  
> _Microeconomic Analysis_ has been a fixture of graduate programs in economics for fifteen years. It has held this position because it has the authority, the clarity, and the breadth necessary for a classic text. This new Third Edition continues to supply the building blocks of microeconomic analysis: a thorough treatment of optimization and equilibrium methods, coupled with numerous examples of their application.
> 
> The Third Edition expands on the earlier editions in two ways. First, the existing coverage has been rewritten and rearranged. Second, new chapters have been added on game theory, oligopoly, asset markets, and information economics. The rearrangement follows the model of Hal Varian's Intermediate Microeconomics: a number of short chapters, each devoted to a single topic. In fact, the topical division is as close as possible to that of the undergraduate text. This makes it easy to review undergraduate material before moving on to graduate material. The new chapters highlight significant developments in microeconomic theory in the last ten years at a level that is accessible for first-year graduate students.
> 
> Classic features: * Emphasis on the dual approach to consumer and firm behavior. * Integration of the modem analytic approach with classical price theory * Analysis of economic behavior using classical methods of comparative statics, duality, and nonparametric methods. * Emphasis on analytical techniques that are useful in applied research.
> 
> Highlights of the revision: * New chapter on game theory that provides an appropriate introduction for first-year students. * New chapter on oligopoly that features many of the recent developments in this area. * New chapter on asset markets that describes "what every economist should know" about the theory of financial markets. * New chapter on information economics that provides a unified treatment of incentives and markets in the presence of information asymmetries.

> Description:  
> This is a completely captivating account of the "great age of piracy" (1716-1726) and surrounding years, by an economist who loved pirates as a boy, has had an economics supply and demand diagram tattooed to his bicep since he was 17, and who proposes to his girl friend Ania in the dedication, declaring that if she turns him down, he will join the legion of pirates about whom he writes.  
>   
> Leeson correctly notes that most historians do not know economics and hence cannot deal with important parts of the piracy phenomenon. Throughout the book he stresses that the supply of pirates is a function of the wage and level of demand for "legitimate" seamen, which is itself a function of the level of inter-country hostilities. He notes that the penchant of pirates for torturing their captives was limited to those who refused to divulge the whereabouts of the booty or who resisted capture. Torture was thus just a reputation-making device that lowered the cost of doing business for pirates. Leeson also stresses that pirates had much better working conditions than legitimate seamen, who were subject to the arbitrary and often cruel and bitterly selfish authority of the ship's captain.  
>   
> In one important respect, Leeson is putting one over on the innocent reader. He suggests that the democratic structure of the pirate ship can be understood in terms of standard economic theory of the rational self-interested actor. A democratic ship was a preferred work environment for pirates, so they instituted political democracy (electing and recalling pirate captains) because they controlled the organization of production on the pirate ship. This may well be true, but this is hardly what we learn in standard economic theory. First, why would a rational self-interest pirate bother to attend meetings, listen to speeches, and vote for a captain? Assuming one vote cannot change the outcome of the election with more than infinitesimal probability, voting is an altruistic act, not a self-interested act.  
>   
> Now of course perhaps it could be argued that pirate ships only have a maximum of 500 pirates, so the probabilities, costs, and benefits indicate that democratic participation is a self-regarding act of a rational pirate. But Leeson says nothing about this at all, leaving it to the unsophistication of the reader not to notice the problem.  
>   
> Moreover, standard economic theory of the firm suggests that informational and agency issues lead to a set of owners virtually disjoint from the set of producers; i.e., since Alchian and Demsetz at least, firms have managers hired by owners, and managers hire and control workers. The idea of democratic worker control flowing from the standard theory is bizarre, to say the least. Leeson does address the principal-agent problem, saying "On the pirate ship, then, the principals were the agents." (p. 41) But this quite misleading. In the principal agent model there is a single principal, not a group of principals. The model does not work at all unless the principals, supposing they are a plurality, can somehow be aggregated into a single decision-maker. Moreover, the fact that the principals are the agents in no way solves the principal-agent problem---each agent still has an incentive to shirk, indeed almost as great an incentive as when there is a single, separate, owner of the ship serving as agent.  
>   
> I conclude that there is still a lot more to be said about the organization of piracy than is touched on in this book. But Leeson has given us an exciting start.

> ince the end of the second World War, economics professors and classroom textbooks have been telling us that the economy is one big machine that can be effectively regulated by economic experts and tuned by government agencies like the Federal Reserve Board. It turns out they were wrong. Their equations do not hold up. Their policies have not produced the promised results. Their interpretations of economic events -- as reported by the media -- are often of-the-mark, and unconvincing.
> 
> A key alternative to the one big machine mindset is to recognize how the economy is instead an evolutionary system, with constantly-changing patterns of specialization and trade. This book introduces you to this powerful approach for understanding economic performance. By putting specialization at the center of economic analysis, Arnold Kling provides you with new ways to think about issues like sustainability, financial instability, job creation, and inflation. In short, he removes stiff, narrow perspectives and instead provides a full, multi-dimensional perspective on a continually evolving system.
